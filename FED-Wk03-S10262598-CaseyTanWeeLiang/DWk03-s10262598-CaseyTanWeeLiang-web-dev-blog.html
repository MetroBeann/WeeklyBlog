        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <p>First FED Class</p>
        <pre>
In the first FED class, I was introduced to the basic of html css. 
To my surprise, it was actually different from coding as I thought would be similar.
However, despite the difference, I find it quite comprehensible and I understand how website is being developed.

        <p>Second FED Class</p>
        <pre>
In this week class, I managed to start my very first html css project, which is creating a website for food recipe. 
I also designed this webpage to detail down my weekly progress on my html css project.
With the very basic knowledge of html css, I am now able to design a simple website without the need to use third party website such as Wix.

        <h1>Week 3</h1>
        <p>Third FED Class</p>
        <pre>
During this week, I gained a deeper understanding of HTML tags like form, input, labels, and button. I also grasped the concept of using ID and class selectors for styling elements.
I explored the use of media queries, specifically for mobile applications, and learned how to adjust the layout based on different screen sizes. 
Additionally, I acquired knowledge on positioning elements using keywords such as Static, Absolute, Relative, and Fixed.
Flexbox was a valuable concept that I learned about. It allows content to adapt and resize as needed, which is incredibly useful for accommodating various content types. 
I also delved into creating wireframes, which have proven to be a useful tool for visualizing the layout and design of my content.

        <h1>Week 4</h1>
        <p>Fourth FED Class</p>
        <pre>
In this week class, I understand the function of using Flex Layouts and how to create reponsive images.
I also understand the needs and basics of Gits. Like, how it can help me arrange my file in different versions and edit them whenever I wish. 
I think Git is a very useful tool to organise code as the functions helps me keep track of my progress. 
I also like how it allow collaboration with other people as it could come convenient for group projects.
I have implemented Github for multiple assignments such as FED and PRG2 as well.

In this week lesson, I understand the very basic of Javascript and how to use it together with html and css.
I am able to figure out the difference bteween using Literal Objects and Function-Based Objects.
I think that Javascript has similar operation as C# as they both uses Object Orientated Programming.
However, in Javascript, we don't need to declare types unlike C#. This makes it more flexible and easier to use.

In this week lesson, I understand the basic of DOM (Document Object Model), where DOM Tree is a model created by a browser when it loads a webpage.
I also got to know more about Javascript such as its elements (getElementById, QuerySelector etc).
I also managed to submit my Assignment 1 for FED this week for a singer called D4VD, and uploaded the file on Github.
By implementing what I have learnt this lesson, I successfully managed to create a responsive Next and Previous button, and Audio playing image by using Javascript.

In this week lesson, I understood how the basic of API and how to fetch them. 
API is a programming interface that request data and bring back a response. 
It provides additional functionality and features, customisation and flexibility to benefit our website.
With API, we can use real world data such as Weather data, where it changes everytime.
By accessing API, we can use Postman as it simplifies the reading, and it helps to make development faster.
I managed to learn how to fetch API, when there is key needed or not, by using fetch(url).
I also understood that AJAX is important to fetch API as it can send and request data from server in the background without disturbing the active page.

In this week lesson, I understand how to implement BootStrap in my website. 
In this web blog, I have implemented navbar from BootStrap, to help navigate blogs from different week easily.
As well as carousel effect from BootStrap, implemented on Week 5 whitespace submission.
It provides many templates for many features, such as Cards, Navigaton Bar, Forms and more.
I find bootstrap extremely beneficial as it could save plenty of time for user while still achieving the same quality.
I also found out how to make your own chart by linking to CloudFare. 
I think this could be very beneficial for long term as there could be plenty of occassions where charts are needed.

In this week lesson, I understand what's RestDB and NoSQL.
Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to manipulate and retrieve data from structured data format and hold relationships between them.
While NoSQL provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of unstructured data, it can handle a humongous amount of data and has a dynamic scheme.
It is best fit for unstructured data and works better for larger datasets.
Using restdb.io is simple and helps us to create our own online storage.

In this week lesson, I learnt what are the best practises and common mistake while developing a website.
Mainly on how to format ReadME, commit messages properly, structuring files and name them appropriately 
and how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Templates appropriately.
I also learnt that we should always do testing for our website, such as using W3C MarkUp Validator, CSS Validator, Link Validator and more.

In this week lesson, I learnt how to implement Lottie's Animation to make my webpage visualisation looks better.
Lottie is a JSON-based animation file that performs animation and allow additional interaction on websites.
Lottie is extremely lightweight and only takes up a small file size.
It works closely with SVG or After Effects to create the interactivity.
I have implemented Lottie's Animation on my Assignment2 as I believe pictures speaks a thousand words, and even better if its animating.
Therefore, it helps me to cut down my word usage to prevent my website looking wordy and messy.
